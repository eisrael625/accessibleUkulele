# Accessible Ukulele

The Accessible Ukulele is an attachment to any standard sized ukulele that allows a player to select the series of chords they would like to play through a Bluetooth App, and then the device holds down the chords in progression for you, allowing the player to create music just by strumming, with the chords switching autonomously. 


--Behind the design

The Musical Soldier

In my school’s Veteran’s day assembly, I heard the story of a soldier who had great musical talent, but, unfortunately, lost his ability to play the guitar after he was injured in battle. I was tasked with writing him a note, expressing my gratefulness for his sacrifice, but it seemed in-genuine. I thought, “Maybe I could fix his problem, and not just sympathize with it.” Since then, I have heard the stories of so many individuals who have lost ability to play an instrument they held so closely to their heart. Whether it was a girl who developed a tremor in one of her hands, making it impossible to hold down chords, or a man who got paralyzed in one arm, the stories of individuals not being able to pursue music pained me. I had a deep desire to help.

Deeply involved in the special needs community, I have also discovered that my device might have great impacts on many individuals with special needs. Music is a calming experience for so many, and I desire to enable individuals who are unable to either hold down the chords or learn the intricacies of music playing, to be able to play the guitar.

Music For All

Several weeks after my initial exposure to the idea, I sat down in my room and was listening to music. The music was calming, but I felt like it was not personal. I had a great sudden urge to be able to control it, to be able to pick up a guitar and play it masterly. However, within a few minutes, I realized that the art involves incredible skill, and it is not enough to be musically talented or be able to read sheet music; the mastery of an instrument requires hard work and dedication. I thought to myself, “What if it was much easier for an individual to be able to pick up an instrument and feel like they are changing the environment around them?” The power of music is great and I intend to make it accessible to all.

--Design

I began my design of the product by thinking of the requirements.

1) The strings cannot be touched when they are not being firmly held down.
2) I need to minimally have three frets of strings (6×3 = 18 spots) that are able to be held down.
3) The device has to be able to stay by itself on the guitar
4) The device has to be able to be controlled by a reasonable number of motors.

I researched different methods which I could use to hold down the strings and decided that a camshaft would work the best. A camshaft is a rod with ovular objects perpendicularly placed at different angles and heights, allowing for the pressing down of objects, with the rotation of the camshaft.

I then decided that I could use springs to keep the pegs in the upright position, until the camshaft holds it down.
